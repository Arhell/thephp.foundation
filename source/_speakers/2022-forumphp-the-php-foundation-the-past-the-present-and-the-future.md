"A complex saga of developers scattered around the world, all living under the rule of the elePHPant technology."

PHP is going to die. We're all going to die. We've been around PHP for over two decades, and we've seen many concepts
and tools gaining and losing favor. That's the knowledge we aim to apply for the support and advancement of the PHP
language.

The PHP Foundation is a non-profit organization formed a year ago by well-known PHP folks as well as major companies
from the PHP ecosystem. Come to this session to learn what we have achieved during our first year and what we are
planning next. Weâ€™re eager to answer your questions and look forward to hearing your suggestions.
