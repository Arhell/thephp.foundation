		<p>
			The <strong>PHP Foundation</strong> is a collective established with the
			non-profit mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP
			language. We are a community of PHP veterans, community
			leaders, and technology companies that rely on PHP as a
			critical digital infrastructure. We collaborate to ensure
			PHP language long-term success and maintenance.
		</p>

		<p>
			People and businesses may come and go, so it is vital to
			ensure that the PHP source code will survive beyond the
			current contributor base. We wish to contribute to the
			creation and maintenance of a stable language for
			generations to come.
		</p>

		<p>
			The formation of the PHP Foundation was announced in
			November 2021 and the PHP Foundation initiative runs with
			the administration whose goal is to find such an
			organization structure that will ensure a long-term
			sustainability of the PHP language development.

        <p>
            The current group collective administration focuses on maintaining the
            continuity of the PHP project, in particular on hiring, supporting, and
            guiding PHP project developers. The Administration also encourages
            other Financial Contributors and explores strategic partnerships and
            needs for the PHP project.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Administrator consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP
            community leaders, representatives of the founding companies, and other
            key stakeholders. In 2022, this is an invitation-only group, while
            weâ€™re working to get our processes solidified.
        </p>

        <p>
            To promote transparency, we operate as <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation">a collective on the Open
            Collective platform</a>,
            through which we ensure certain activities, such as selection and
            financing of PHP core developers contributing to the development of the
            PHP language. The decisions about these activities are taken by
            consensus by the administration members, which meet regularly, and are
            executed by the collective administrators.
        </p>

        <p>
            All administration members of the PHP Foundation as well as
            contributors and PHP developers are expected to abide by the <a href="code_of_conduct">Code of
            Conduct</a>
            and follow our collective expectations guidelines and <a href="https://opencollective.com/tos">Terms of
            Service</a> of the platform operated by
            Open Collective Inc.

                The primary task of the PHP Foundation is to fund developers to work on
                PHP. Funds collected through the Open Collective platform may be used
                in the first place to engage the services of PHP developers in order to
                further advance the development and maintenance of the language.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current Request for Comments (RFC) is not affiliated to the PHP
                Foundation, and the language decisions are the matter of the PHP
                Internals community.
